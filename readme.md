# Gerobak.js

Extending [basketjs](https://github.com/addyosmani/basket.js) to load scripts dynamically based on custom data attribute.


## How to use it

- Make sure you include the `rsvp.js` and `basket.js` or just use `gerobak.full.min.js`.
- Put `gerobak-load="your/dir/to/script.js"` anywhere on your document.
- Done. Gerobak will automatically read and load it for you. Simple isn't it? Enjoy and keep async! :)
